# Ricursive-stuff

This repository, contains a C project with an implementation of some recursive functions.

## **Functions locations**

The function's protoypes are declared inside **libs** folder in a file called **recursive.h**. The implementation can be found inside the file called **recursive.c**. 

## **Function list**

The following list contains all the functions implemented in this project.

### **Function for string manipulations**

- A function to copy a string into another;
- A function to invert a string;
- A function to search the index of the first capital letter;
- A function to establish if the given string is palindrom or not;

### **Function to perform operations on numerical arrays**

- A function to perform a recursive search ofthe minimum number;
- A function to perform a recursive binary search;
- A function to perform a recursive linear search;
- A function to perform a recursive bubble sort;
- A function that sum even numbers and multiplicates the odds ones, recursevely
- A function to print an array;

### **Classic recursive algorithms**

- Factorial;
- Fibonacci;
